## 0th Law
There exists, for every thermodynamic system in equilibrium, a property called temperature.
Equality of temperature is a necessary and sufficient condition for thermal equilibrium.

## Ideal Gas
- standard model of real gases, idelizaed.  
- Properties:  
	- No volume
	- kinetic energy only
	- All Colission elastic

&rarr; Good approximation for low perssures

$p \cdot V = n\: R_m \: T = m \: R \: T$


formula is derived by the following findings

## conversion of ideal gas to real gas

Compressibility factor $Z$:

$pV = ZRT$

$Z = \frac{\rho_{ideal}}{\rho_{real}} $


## Ideal liquid

-standard model of real liquids, idelizaed.
-incompressable, inviscid(zero viscoity)

=>change in pressure/tempertaure: aprrox. constant volume
$V = const != f(T,p)$

## Work 

-form of energy transported over the system bondarys(except heat)

## Volume/Displacement work

Displacement work:

Voulme expansion conducts work(gas piston)

$\delta W = -p \cdot A \cdot dx = -p \cdot  dV$

Integration over whole displacement:

$W_{1,2,V} = - \int_{1}^{2} p\ dV$

Sign convetion from the perspective "inside" the system, means if the system gains energy => negative sign of work

## Heat and heat Flow

-Heat is the other part of energy transported over system boundarys
-Heat is transported due to temperature differences

### Heat $Q$:  
-can alter the system state
-adiabatic: no heat is transferd

### Heat Flow Q:  
$ \dot{Q} = \frac{dQ}{dt}$
