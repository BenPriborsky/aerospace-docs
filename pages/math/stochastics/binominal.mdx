# Binomial Coefficient

Binomial coefficients are numbers that tell you how many ways you can choose a certain number of items from a group without caring about the order. They're handy for counting possibilities in things like combinations and probability calculations.

<Math e="{n \choose k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}" />

## More formulas

The Binomial coefficient is 1 when:

<Math e="{n \choose n} = {n \choose 0} = 1" />

more formulas

<Math e="(x+y)^n = \sum{k=0}{n} {n \choose k } x^k y^{n-k}" />
