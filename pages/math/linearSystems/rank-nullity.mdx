# Rank-Nullity Theorem

Let $T:V -> W$ be a linear transformation between two vector spaces
## Formel
$rank(T)+nullity(T)\dim(V)$  
$dim(V)$ is the number of columns in $T$.

## Nullity
Nullity is the dimension of the kernel: $dim(kern(T))$

## Surjective linear transformation:
If theRank is full the transformation is [surjective](https://www.formulas.site/math/sets/functions#mapping-properties)

## Injective linear transformation:
If the dimension of the Kernel is 0 the transformation is [Injective](https://www.formulas.site/math/sets/functions#mapping-properties)
